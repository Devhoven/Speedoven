# Speedoven
A speedometer for a bike, built with the Seeed Xiao ESP32-C3 and an ePaper-display from Waveshare.

It retreives the speed data from the sensors of the Sigma Pure 1 - speedometer. <br>
The navigation data is gathered via a BLE connection with an Android-phone running Komoot. 

A few things are planned: 
- A 3D-printed case to mount it on the bike 
- Saving the font-data on the SPIFF-System of the ESP
